GenAI Architecting, I had gone deep into the TOGAF architecture and the diagrams that Rola gave, I deeply understood the process, and I tried my best to fill in all the sections under the Wiki document for GenAI architecting.

For Sentence Constructor, I tried DeepSeek R1, ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 2.0 flash, Claude Sonet, Mistal AI, Perplexity AI and IBM Granite. Also made use of the prompt document of Damien.

GenAI Architecting, Since I tried to answer or fill in the Wiki document sections I had a deeper understanding of my knowledge in Conceptual and Logical diagrams but have yet to get my hands dirty with Physical diagrams.

Sentence Constructor, I used the same prompt document for all the AI-powered assistants, DeepSeek R1 was free to use, ChatGPT 4o had limitations of 10 prompts, Gemini 2.0 flash was free to use , Claude Sonet had 10 prompts, Mistal AI was free until I tried, Perplexity AI was also free until I tried and IBM Granite had limitation of 25 prompts.

GenAI architecting, Understood the Architecting framework - TOGAF

Sentance Constructor, I found DeepSeek R1 was good but the responses was short with out examples.
ChatGPT 4o was okish something we could relay on but its paid.
Gemini 2.0 flash was not good at all.
Claude Sonet was good but its paid.
Mistral AI was good and its free.
Perplexity AI was good and its free.
IBM Granite was very good.

Overall I found for an AI agent to be an Spanish sentence assistant IBM Granite, Mistral , Perplexity and DeepSeek and GTP4o to be good. i would give rating the order I have mentioned.
